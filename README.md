## Building a Mobile Layout

Designing for mobile is challenging. With the ever changing landscape of devices and screen sizes, there is no way to predict every possible canvas weâ€™ll be desiging for. Luckily, there are few tools at our disposal that we can use to be confident in our designs.

In this session we will introduce some of these tools, including flexible grids and media queries. We will also dive into some code and see how these components can be created and how we can avoid some common pitfalls along the way.
